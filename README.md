a twitter-style approach to sharing and saving your favorite licks.

made possible through the wonders of the [abc music notation](https://abcnotation.com/), paul rosen's [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs), and a couple peeks at rigo bauer's [react snippets](https://github.com/rigobauer/react-abcjs) (this stuff was surprisingly tricky to get to render in react and keep unique refs and ids etc etc).

built with next.js and typescript
